# ApresentadorPessoal

This project is an interactive chatbot that answers questions about Jimmy, using information from his LinkedIn, professional summary, and GitHub repositories. The bot can record unanswered questions and collect contact details from interested users, serving as a personal presentation tool for potential employers or clients.


## How does it work?

The system should be deployed into HuggingFace.co. There will be a basic UI Chat where users can chat with the OpenAI chat model with my own personal context.

If someone wants to know me better and send his/her email, then I will receive an push notification from Pushover app in my iPhone.
